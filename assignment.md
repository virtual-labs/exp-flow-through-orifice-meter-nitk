<li> Derive the flow equation for the orifice meter from first principles.</li>
<li> What are the different types of orifice plates? Indicate the suitable application of
each of the type.</li>
<li> An orifice meter is to be installed in a 12-in ductile iron pipe carrying water at 15.5&deg; C. A mercury manometer is to be used to measure the pressure difference across the orifice when the expected range of the flow rate is from 5700 lit/min to 15500 lit/min. The manometer scale ranges from 0 to 30.5 cm of mercury. Determine the appropriate diameter of the orifice.</li>
